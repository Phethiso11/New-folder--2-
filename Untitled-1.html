 <p style ="font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: x-large;">Any way back to the point.Right now I am going to talk about peer pressure</p>
 <h2 style="background-color: red; width: 250px; height: 1%;">Peer Pressure</h2>

 <div class="scroll-box" style="width: 700px; color: yellow; margin: 10px; height: 190px;">
  <p>Peer pressure is when you get influenced by someone, like example ecspeically your friend, it is a social phenomenon where individuals are influenced by their peers, often resulting in the adoption of certain behaviors, attitudes, or values to conform to group norms. It is commonly associated with adolescence and young adulthood but can be present in various stages of life. Here are some key points to understand about peer pressure.Its good if they influence you to do some thing good.But if its something bad its not good at all.When I mean bad I mean like example smoking, drinking, having sexual parterns and the list goes on.So this are the ways to avoid it:by saing no to them, if they keep on insisting, go away from them and never hang out with them unless they prove that they have changed.Honestly speaking, for a point in my life I found it hard to avoid it.Examine the various forms of negative peer pressure and its impact on decision-making and behavior. Provide anecdotes that shed light on the subtle and overt ways peer pressure manifests.</p>
</div>
  <p style="color: brown; font-size: x-large; background-color: aqua;">You back in the days we used to go to school trips.And the only reason we will be excited not because we will be going out, because we will be eating a lot snacks like this:</p>
<img src="https://image.freepik.com/free-photo/unhealthy-sweets-set-sweets-badly-affecting-skin-body-shape-well-being_84130-3296.jpg" width="300px" height="300px">
<p style="color: brown; font-size: x-large;">All going in <strong>ones</strong> tummy.We will be eating so much sugar, the next day almost half of the class wil not be there because they will be sick of stomach ache.</p>
<p style="color: blue; font-size: x-large; background-color: chartreuse;">And talking about sugar, I no longer eat that much sugar any more, because my mother realized that eating a lot of sugar is not healthy.Well everyone knows that sugar is not healthy, but I mean I can eat one packet of potato chips ones a month.Back in the days my mom used to feed my brother and I a lot of sugar.I thank god my mom realized that.Your probally wondering why I am saying that, because I now know that sugar is bad and you should know too, so I recommend you should not eat a lot of sugar or you will get yourself sick.But if your stubborn do what you want to do.</p>
<h2 style="color: black; font-size: larger;">Chapter 4</h2>
<p style="color: brown; font-size: x-large; font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; background-color: rgb(255, 183, 0);">Now i'm going to talk about the most important thing in life, which is not money but love.Many people will say money.I am not saying money is useless at all.But be be careful about money, as in the Bible it says "keep your love away from money".Talking about money beware of fake friends, friends that dont really like you but love the money or what you have not who you are.These are some of the ways to comfirm that they are real friends: 1.When they come over to you and first thing they do is to ask you for the thing they come for it is clear they are fake 2.Ok lets say they they greet and ask you for the thing they come tell them you are not allowed to use whatever they ask for anymore, give them two or three days they will stop coming to you.Be careful, use these things to people you are suspicious with.</p>

It is a complex tapestry woven with moments of joy, sorrow, love, and growth. Each individual's life follows a unique path, shaped by their choices, circumstances, and interactions with the world around them. 
 
  At times, life may present unexpected twists and turns, testing one's resilience and adaptability. It offers opportunities for personal development, self-discovery, and the forging of meaningful connections with others. Through the highs and lows, individuals navigate the complexities of existence, seeking purpose, fulfillment, and a sense of belonging. 
   
  As life unfolds, it often reveals the beauty of impermanence and the inevitability of change. People learn to embrace the present moment, cherish memories of

  <span style="background-color: #ff8a00;" class="gradient-text">Life is a journey, a series of experiences that shape and define who we are. It's a dynamic process filled with a mix of challenges and opportunities, victories and setbacks. From the moment we're born, we embark on a path of growth, learning, and self-discovery.

    Education becomes a foundation, providing us with the tools to navigate an ever-evolving world. As we step into adulthood, we encounter the complexities of relationships, career choices, and personal development. Life is a continuous learning curve, a journey that often involves adapting to unexpected twists and turns.
    
    Work and career play a significant role, as we strive to find purpose and contribute to society. Along the way, we form connections with family, friends, and colleagues, building a network of support that sustains us through life's challenges.
    
    Health becomes a paramount concern, prompting a balance between physical well-being and mental resilience. The pursuit of happiness and fulfillment leads us to explore passions, hobbies, and personal interests.
    
    Life is also marked by moments of joy and sorrow, love and loss. Embracing these experiences with resilience and an open heart enables personal growth and the development of a rich tapestry of memories.
    
    In the grand scheme of things, life is a finite journey. Time moves forward, and as we reflect on the past, we recognize the importance of making meaningful contributions, leaving a positive impact on those around us.
    
    Ultimately, the trajectory of our lives is shaped by choices, experiences, and the connections we make along the way. It's a journey of

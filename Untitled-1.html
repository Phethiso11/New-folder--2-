<h2 style="border: 2px yellow;">Chapter 1</h2>
<p style="color: blue;">As a kid you always know that you wake up early go to school, go back and all that stuff.</p>
<p style="width: auto;">My point is all those stuff you learn are not even helpful.Well some off them.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 149, 10);">As soon as my dad realized that I stoped going to school for about 2years.</p>
<p style="color: red;">YES I DID NOT GO TO SCHOOL FOR <strong>TWO</strong> YEARS</p>
<p style="color: black;">You are probally wondering why  I am saying school is not useful</p>
<p style="color: rgb(85, 5, 13);">Example some schools you are taught about ants, what is an ant going to help you with?</p>
<p>Do you <strong>know</strong> get my dad's points</p>
<p style="color: black;">So I stoped going to school until he found a good school which I am in right know.</p>
<p style="color: purple;">And to be honest the school I am in is pretty good, and I love it!</p>
<p style="color: purple;">In the school we are thaught how to code stuff like web pages, games and other things</p>
<p style="color: purple;" aria-setsize="50px">And another thing that is good about it is that its not only in one country, its in many countrys!</p>

<h2 style="font-size: xx-large;">Chapter 3</h2>
<p style="font-size: xx-large;">Ok back in the box, where was I?Oh I was talking about my story, but forget that this is another chapter.</p>
<p style="color: coral;">I told you in my last chapter I wanted to make cartoons because I am in to cartoons, well some of them.When I say cartoons I dont mean the childish ones like mikey-mouse and the other ones like it.And I in to anime also.</p>
<p style="font-size: large;">I would recommend you to watch anime like <p style="font-size: x-large;"> yu hakusho:</p><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.-bTgIunC7d2ChKxt7jeM0AHaF6?w=650&h=519&rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain" width="1000" height="600"><p style="font-size: x-large;">Demon slayer:</p><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.s8-1leJhMJEMdPDLegHBOgHaEK?w=800&h=450&rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain" width="1000" height="600"></p>
<p style="font-size: large;">And anime like that.But it actually depends on your age.</p>
<p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace ;" aria-setsize="1000px"></p>
  
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Anime</th>
      <th>Age</th>
      
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Naruto</td>
      <td>11+</td>
      
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Yu yu hakusho</td>
      <td>14+</td>
      
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Demon slayer</td>
      <td>14+</td>
      
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>One piece</td>
      <td>11+</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
    
 <p style ="font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Any way back to the point.Right now I am going to talk about peer pressure</p>
 <h2 style="background-color: red; width: 250px;">Peer Pressure</h2>

  <div style="width: 40%;"><p class="box" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0%; padding: 0%;">Peer pressure is when you get influenced by someone, like example ecspeically your friend.Its good if they influence you to do some thing good.But if its something bad its not good at all.When I mean bad I mean like example smoking, drinking, having sexual parterns and the list goes on.So this are the ways to avoid it:by saing no to them, if they keep on insisting go away from them and never hang out with them unless thhey prove that they have changed.</p></div>

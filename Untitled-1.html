<p style="color: blue; font-size: x-large;">As a kid you always know that you wake up early go to school, go back and all that stuff.</p>

<p style="color: rgb(0, 149, 10); font-size: x-large;">As soon as my dad realized that I stoped going to school for about 2years.</p>
<p style="color: red; font-size: x-large;">YES I DID NOT GO TO SCHOOL FOR <strong>TWO</strong> YEARS</p>
<p style="color: black; font-size: x-large;">You are probally wondering why  I am saying school is not useful</p>
<p style="color: rgb(85, 5, 13); font-size: x-large;">Example some schools you are taught about ants, what is an ant going to help you with?</p>
<p style="font-size: x-large;">Do you <strong>know</strong> get my dad's points</p>
<p style="color: black; font-size: x-large;">So I stoped going to school until he found a good school which I am in right know.</p>
<p style="color: purple; font-size: x-large;">And to be honest the school I am in is pretty good, and I love it!</p>
<p style="color: purple; font-size: x-large;">In the school we are thaught how to code stuff like web pages, games and other things</p>
<p style="color: purple; font-size: x-large;">And another thing that is good about it is that its not only in one country, its in many countrys!</p>

    <p style="font-size: x-large;">As a kid I always wanted to be a policeman but my freinds always told me the disadvantage of being a policeman, one of them said"his dad died being a policemn".Let me tell you something you should never care of what your freinds say, or anyone, if you want to do something do it!</p>
    </div> 
    
    <div class="city">

    </div>
    
    <div class="city">
    <h2>In Sixth Grade</h2>
    <p style="font-size: x-large;">In sixth grade I got interested in being a music artist and in being a soccer player.If you're wodering who is my favorite soccer player honestly I could say Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>
    </div>

<h2 style="font-size: xx-large;">Chapter 3</h2>
<p style="font-size: xx-large;">Ok back in the box, where was I?Oh I was talking about my story, but forget that this is another chapter.</p>
<p style="color: coral; font-size: x-large; background-color: crimson;">I told you in my last chapter I wanted to make cartoons because I am in to cartoons, well some of them.When I say cartoons I dont mean the childish ones like mikey-mouse and the other ones like it.And I in to anime also.</p>
<p style="font-size: x-large;">I would recommend you to watch anime like <p style="font-size: x-large;"> yu hakusho:</p><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.-bTgIunC7d2ChKxt7jeM0AHaF6?w=650&h=519&rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain" width="1000" height="600"><p style="font-size: x-large;">Demon slayer:</p><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.s8-1leJhMJEMdPDLegHBOgHaEK?w=800&h=450&rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain" width="1000" height="600"></p>
<p style="font-size: x-large;">And anime like that.But it actually depends on your age.</p>
<p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace ; font-size: x-large;">Here are the age recommends</p>
  
  <table style="font-size: x-large; color: blue;">
    <tr>
      <th>Anime</th>
      <th>Age</th>
      
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Naruto</td>
      <td>11+</td>
      
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Yu yu hakusho</td>
      <td>14+</td>
      
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Demon slayer</td>
      <td>14+</td>
      
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>One piece</td>
      <td>11+</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
    
 <p style ="font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: x-large;">Any way back to the point.Right now I am going to talk about peer pressure</p>
 <h2 style="background-color: red; width: 250px;">Peer Pressure</h2>

  <div style="width: 40%;"><p class="box" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0%; padding: 0%; font-size: large;">Peer pressure is when you get influenced by someone, like example ecspeically your friend.Its good if they influence you to do some thing good.But if its something bad its not good at all.When I mean bad I mean like example smoking, drinking, having sexual parterns and the list goes on.So this are the ways to avoid it:by saing no to them, if they keep on insisting, go away from them and never hang out with them unless they prove that they have changed.Honestly speaking, for a point in my life I found it hard to avoid it.</p></div>
  <p style="color: brown; font-size: x-large; background-color: aqua;">You back in the days we used to go to school trips.And the only reason we will be excited not because we will be going out, because we will be eating a lot snacks like this:</p>
<img src="https://image.freepik.com/free-photo/unhealthy-sweets-set-sweets-badly-affecting-skin-body-shape-well-being_84130-3296.jpg" width="300px" height="300px">
<p style="color: brown; font-size: x-large;">All going in <strong>ones</strong> tummy.We will be eating so much sugar, the next day almost half of the class wil not be there because they will be sick of stomach ache.</p>
<p style="color: blue; font-size: x-large; background-color: chartreuse;">And talking about sugar, I no longer eat that much sugar any more, because my mother realized that eating a lot of sugar is not healthy.Well everyone know that sugar is not healthy, but I mean I can eat one packet of potato chips ones a month.Back in the days my mom used to feed my brother and I a lot of sugar.I thank god my mom realized that.Your probally wondering why I am saying that, because I now know that sugar is bad and you should know too, so I recommend you should not eat a lot of sugar or you will get yourself sick.But if your stubborn do what you want to do.</p>
<h2 style="color: black;">Chapter 4</h2>
<p style="color: brown; font-size: x-large; font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; background-color: rgb(255, 183, 0);">Now i'm going to talk about the most important thing in life, which is not money but love.Many people will say money.I am not saying money is useless at all.But be be careful about money, as in the Bible it says "keep your love away from money".Talking about money beware of fake friends, friends that dont really like you but love the money or what you have not who you are.These are some of the ways to comfirm that they are real friends: 1.When they come over to you and first thing they do is to ask you for the thing they come for it is clear they are fake 2.Ok lets say they they greet and ask you for the thing they come tell them you are not allowed to use whatever they ask for anymore, give them two or three days they will stop coming to you.Be careful, use these things to people you are suspicious with.</p>
